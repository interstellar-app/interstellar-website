Profiles let you save and switch between groups of settings easily. The **main profile** serves as the default, with other profiles overriding specific settings as needed.

## Modifying Profiles

To alter a profile, switch to it and adjust the settings. Currently, to reset an overridden setting back to default, you must delete and recreate the profile.

## Included Settings

- Behavior settings
- Display settings
- Feed actions
- Feed defaults
- Filter list activation status

## Additional Options

- Switch which profile is main
- Auto activate a specific profile at startup
- Auto switch to an account when a certain profile is activated

If you donâ€™t use profiles, just stay on the main profile and the app will function as usual.
